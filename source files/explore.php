                                <p>Yoga is a practice that combines physical movement, breath control, and meditation to promote physical, mental, and spiritual health.
                                To start, find a quiet space where you can comfortably move and sit.
                                Begin with simple poses like child's pose, downward dog, and mountain pose.
                                As you progress, explore different types of yoga such as hatha, vinyasa, and restorative.
                                Remember to breathe deeply and listen to your body.
                                With regular practice, yoga can improve flexibility, strength, and balance, as well as reduce stress and anxiety.</p>
